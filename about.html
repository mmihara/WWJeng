          <p>Mr. Sauer served on many technical committees that provided advisory services on seismic design for structures and formulated many of the policies enforced today by Division of the State Architect and OSHPD, which review the design of Schools and Hospitals in California.</p>
          <p>The company in the early years was known as Sauer-Marr-Grimes-Wood Consulting Engineers, with Arthur Sauer & Joe Wood in the Sacramento office, and Kenneth Marr & Charles Grimes in the Stockton office.</p>
